<h1 class="editable">James River</h1>
		<p class="editable">Canoe the James River for 4 nights and 5 days and take in one of Virginia's most scenic rivers. Paddle 61 miles of the historic upper James River in Virginia from the headwaters at Iron Gate to the Snowden Dam. Experience over 100 class I rapids, and 20 challenging class II rapids, and the infamous Balcony Falls rapid. Bring your fishing pole and try your hand at fishing along the way. Camp nightly at wilderness river side locations along the way. Add an optional river clean up project and this trek meets the 50 Miler award requirements.</p>
		<p class="editable">All medical checks and swim tests will be conducted at Base Camp. We will outfit you with food and see to it that you are ready to hit the river on Monday.</p>
