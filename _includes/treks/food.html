          <p>For both treks, we provide backpacking breakfast, lunch, and dinner for your crew on the trail. During the introductory stations on Monday, River Trek crews will pick up their meals for the whole week. Trail Trek crews will pick up their meals for the first half of the week. The rest will be available with resupply on Wednesday at your Wednesday outpost or other specified location.</p>
          <p>While in base camp, meals are served in our outdoor dining hall. We provide you with Sunday dinner upon your arrival, Monday breakfast before you hit the trail or the river, and Friday dinner upon your return. We also have a continental breakfast on Saturday, if you want to grab something before you get on the road.</p>
          <p>If you have any questions about the menu or have concerns about special dietary concerns, please send us an email
