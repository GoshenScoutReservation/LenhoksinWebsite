<h1>About the Treks</h1>
<p>A week at Lenhok'sin High Adventure begins on Sunday afternoon, with an optional Monday morning arrival accommodation
    for LDS units. Crews spend the first day making final preparations to go on the trail before embarking on Monday
    to spend 5 days and 4 nights on one of three different treks: Lenhok'sin Trail (our main program), James River,
    and Trail &amp; River Combo.</p>
