<h1>Lenhok'sin Trail</h1>
        <div class="toad">
          <p>As our main attraction and primary program, this trek focuses on backpacking through the 4,000+ acres of Goshen
            Scout Reservation and 35,000 acres of surrounding state game lands.</p>
          <p>Crews will spend five days and four nights on the trail and will have an opportunity to visit up to four of our
            staffed outposts or other exciting activities.</p>
          <p>Crews fill out a survey prior to arriving at camp. We design Crew itineraries based on the interest in certain
            outposts and award opportunities as indicated by the Crew. Itineraries can fit a wide range of Crew abilities,
            from experienced backpackers to those who have only been a few times before.</p>
